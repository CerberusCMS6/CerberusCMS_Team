Hi, my name is Christopher. I am from California. I am here to document my own * DIRECT * ancestors and maybe some of my dead relatives. I want to keep everything completely accurate. I was born 23rd of April In 1986.

* I am part American Indian of Oklahoma Territory and part American Indian from the American South West. Part Danish / Scandinavian of Northern-Europe and part Hispanic of Southern California.

* My new motto
A human being lives only once, then dies and that's it. The act of existing is a blessing or a curse from the Universe. It seems impossible that anything exists at all. So blood ties, adventures, true friendships and good experiences seem like the most important things in this world. Once you're dead that's it, eternal black. Times flies, remember death.

* What am I doing here ?
I am writing genealogical biographies for each of my direct ancestors and sometimes my dead relatives. For my notable direct ancestors I am writing complete historical biographies based on authentic, certified documented proofs that come from that direct ancestor. If the information is not in my * DIRECT * ancestry then I probably don't care about it in the ways that I care about the information in my * DIRECT * ancestry.

* My family history book
Unfortunately in ~2017 - 2018 I lost my family book that I had worked so hard to complete. I had lost it 10 years before that and then I had recovered it. This included family photographs and extensive proofs-of-parentage. I no longer have this physically but most of it was digitized into my digital ancestral research accounts and this book could easily be recreated physically.

My original plan was to write an extremely documented family history book divided into sections of bloodlines with each section containing extensive proofs-of-parentage, pictures of all original documentation and sources for each ancestor along with authentic ancestral histories and handed down family 'artifacts', lists of Jus' Sanguinis or 'by the right-of-blood' Organizations qualified for and other things in this category. The entire book would go back 10 - 15 generations. I selected the binding materials for this book to last for centuries. I had hoped to preserve this highly detailed information and hand these books out to relatives. I am still working on this project in my spare time. This work is based on an earlier family book compiled by my Grandmother and from what I hear some of this information was compiled by her Grandmother.

In addition to this book I planned to create, amend and correct professional digital entries of my historically significant ancestors as well as the ones who are important to me. So far I have categorized sections of the book and found all of my Catholic and Protestant ancestors for 10 generations. Currently I am looking for all of my noble and Royal ancestors in my 15 generation chart throughout all of my lines. I also found some nobility from Dänemark.

Member of SAR, NSSAR and other organizations.

* What Religion do I practice ?
Update ( 04 - 10 - 2021 ):
I am now a practicing Germanic-Pagan. I underwent the initiation rites of Germanic-Paganism. I practiced this kind of Paganism in my early youth and early 20s when I left the Catholic Church. I was again baptized in the name of the Trinity for validity when I attempted to reenter the Catholic Church. Now, I will no longer be practicing Catholicism at all. However, if you would like education on the authentic Catholic Faith I can give it to you. But, just as the term "Roman Catholic" is a misnomer, so is the word "Pagan". I am glad to have experienced Catholicism and Christian Orthodoxy though, especially Byzantine Christian Orthodoxy. For about 4 years in a row I was able to practice Catholicism of the Latin Rite and of the French Tradition.

* My burial plans
I have planned my own burial where there will be Runes etched into my casket. I will not be cremated. Though through the tradition of this kind of Paganism a practitioner would generally be burned after death I have decided only to be buried. I am looking to secure a transparent casket that can pulled out of a Mausoleum on a tray so my friends, family and maybe others can come and see my body decay into bones over time.

* Why would I place all of this information here ?
Because this is the correct place to put this information. So my own death plans are enforced and so everyone knows what I want. So no one can ever say differently for me, speak for me or claim something else for me. So I can always prove who I am, where I come from and what my religion is. So I can demonstrate my intentions here. Also, I do not speak for any organization or anyone else except for myself.

* My genetics
I know that I will never go bald.

* What nobility and Royalty have I found and can also prove in my direct ancestry ?

Mascaron, Espinassy, Louis IX, Bourbon, Capetian, Garoutte, Lascour, Edwards and many more. We also have valid and provable direct lines to Royal houses of present-day England as well as illegitimate, but provable direct descent from a 19th Century King of Denmark. We only have descent from Western-Europe, Western-Germany and Scandinavian countries for 20 traceable generations. We also have different kinds of descent that is provable from the 6th Earl of Essex, the Count of Narcillac, the Baron de Lascour. Claude Joseph Ernest was born on my birthday.

We are trying to further prove our descent from the Danish Royal House when Christian VIII and his brother lived next to my great great Grandmother on the Island of Föhr and he called her a pretty lady. The King himself was recorded as having said this.

* Some differences between Germanic-Paganism, 11th Century Pagan Styled Catholicism and Catholicism of the Latin Rite:
In Catholicism Saints are prayed to for intervention. Offerings can be made to Saints, the Triune God and the wife and mother of God. Historically this was the exact model given to Germanic-Pagans to bring them into the Catholic Church. In Germanic-Paganism there are numerous Germanic Gods and Goddesses as well as their apparitions. Freyja for example is known to wear different cultural dresses. We also give offerings to statues of our Gods and Goddesses. The offerings today are fruits, foliage, gifts and other things like that. To be very clear: Germanic-Paganism has absolutely nothing to do with Wicca or "Paganism" from other countries or other areas. The Pentagram / Pentacle isn't considered authentic Germanic-Paganism because this symbol isn't Germanic, it comes from an entirely different country. I won't delve further into this information here. Some of my legally proven direct ancestors in Frisia were noted by the Catholic Church as having practiced a kind of Paganism using Runes as late as 1880.

* What is a "Genealogical Biography" ?
A genealogical biography is a list of all of the available records about the person and a historical biography is something entirely different from a genealogical biography.

* What is a "Historical Biography" ?
A historical biography is something that a historian may write about a notable person such as a nobleman, a historically important military officer, a king, a knight, an actor, etc.. I have legally proven in several of my bloodlines my direct or direct lineal descent from historically significant people, such as nobles of various European nations, military officers, politicians, and others. I agnatic, directly or direct lineally descend from historically significant people such as Kings, Barons and nobles of France, nobles of England, and others. And I can prove it every which way possible, by my DNA markers and by my legal proofs-of-parentage.

Biographies written about a historically important person will cite and show authentic, certified records about the person. Records about that person can be found in various places, but generally: depending on the years the person was alive and when the person died one would write a historical biography based on verified, authenticated and certified records ( after each record were investigated and placed into the correct historical context ). Records would be: Certified Birth Certificate or Certified Birth Records, authentic Family Bible Records, Tax Records, Property Records, Land and Deed Records, Personal Wills, Personal Probates, Death Records, Baptismal Records, Confirmation Records, Holy Communion Records, Newspaper Clippings about the person, Marriage Records, Census Records and just about any other records that could be found which legally belong to the person and can be proven.

* What is a "Historically Important Person" ?
Any person who altered history.

* Do I directly descend from historically significant people that altered history ?
I do.

* Can I prove that I directly descend from historically significant people who altered history ?
I can.

* How can I prove that I directly descend from historically significant people ?
By authentic, certified proofs-of-parentage.

* Why do I care about this ?
Because this is a genealogy project and it is fascinating.

* How does "Genealogical Research" tie in with "Historical Research" and "Historicity" ?
Genealogical Research fully ties in with factual Historical Research. In fact, Genealogical Research is capable of proving and disproving any historical narrative, and any history book written by anyone. Genealogy has shown to help disprove and prove any "official" historical narrative regurgitated anywhere. Entire history books taught in public institutions today can be proved or disproved by using Genealogical Research skills especially American history books that are used to teach about historically notable people in American public schools.

Genealogy Research is an excellent way to see historicity, understand antiquity and get all of those juicy details about contemporaries !

* Basic Genealogy Research Methods
So far I have found different ways of conducting genealogy research. By finding and verifying one ancestor and then by gathering all of the available record proofs for that ancestor, then by analyzing the documentation. There could sometimes be 100 or more different recorded documents about the ancestor especially if the ancestor is notable.

* The treasures of Genealogical Research
The real treasures of Genealogical Research is the uncovering of authentic historicity and authentic historical artifacts.

* How is it that many "official" books contain inaccurate information on various histories ?
Many of the books that are used in American public institutions to teach about various histories are inaccurate and censored garbage. Most of the books that are used in American public institutions to teach about various histories do not cite their sources, do not prove their statements by using authentic, certified and proven direct source documentation that was analyzed and verified as authentic by experienced and credentialed historians, they do not provide a bibliography and worse.

Also, even if the sources are provided in the book, after investigating the sources used to make the statements in the book one will find that the statements written in the book do not accurately reflect the sources used in the book and sometimes the sources used to write the statements in the book have nothing to do with the statements made in the book or the sources used in the book are fake ! This is why I say it's mostly garbage.

* Why is much of the information in books available in the United States and elsewhere inaccurate ?
Because the books are written by people who do not know what they are talking about. Many writers are not well researched, they are not well read, they received bad information. Many of the history books are intentionally censored for various reasons.

* What am I mostly interested in at this point ?
Frisian Histories !
Also, I do not have any ancestry from Eastern Germany or Eastern Europe. How do I know this as fact ? Because my proofs-of-parentage for 10 generations before me prove this.

* Why am I interested in Frisian Histories ?
Because I'm authentically Frisian - Germanic - Scandinavian proven by blood and by legal proofs-of-parentage that matches my Ancestral DNA marker tests.

In the future I will make some educational videos as well as make available a research paper that I am writing on the Frisians as part of my digital ancestral research cluster. This will include Historical Frisian Cultures, Frisian Histories. The videos I make will provide thorough rebuttal of inauthentic digital and physical sources for these topics. I will show how each source is inconsistent, where the authentic facts come from and why they are or are not considered authentic facts and sources.

There are only ~3,125 Frisian-Americans that are counted according to most American census records and in 2020 I am counted in them. There are only roughly ~10,000 or probably far less Frisian speakers left in the U.S. according to most authentic sources.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisian_Americans

Frisians completely lost their country in the 20th Century. They had also lost and reclaimed their country in various points of time throughout the 16th Century to the mid 20th Century as Frisian territories were seized to Dänemark, Germany and Niederlande.

There are present day political efforts for reclaiming these territories and for establishing a recognized Frisian Government.

* Respect for Frisians and for Frisian ancestors
If you are not Frisian or if you do not come from the Frisians please do not claim to be Frisian.

* What / Where is Frisia and who were / are the Frisians ?
Frisia today are the areas of the Frisian Islands, Friesland / Fryslân, NordFriesland. Frisia is not only a cultural region it is where the Frisians lived in historically as well as where they live in today. The Frisians are grouped in with the Western-Germanic ethnic group, but they are different because they have their own unique culture and language. Frisians mixed blood with the Dutch, Danish, Norwegians, Flemish and different groups of people from surrounding areas but the ones from the North were hold out groups, apparently. Frisia was split up and came under the ownership of the countries of Niederlande, Germany and Dänemark. Most if not all of the Frisian Islands came under the ownership of those countries. Today, most of the Frisian Islands are used as resort destinations or are lived on mostly by people who are not Frisians. Many Frisian Islands were gradually flooded and disappeared entirely over the centuries especially from the 11th century to the 17th century. Also, the words Frisian / Frisia was and still is pronounced differently in the languages of German, Dansk, Dutch and English.

* Is there a list of Frisian Islands available for digital searches ?
* Niederlande Ownership ( Inhabited ): Juist, Schiermonnikoog, Ameland, Terschelling, Kooiplaats, Vlieland.
* Niederlande Ownership ( Uninhabited ): Simonszand, Boschplaat, Rottumerplaat, Rottumeroog, Eirland, Rif.
* Germany Ownership ( Inhabited ): Amrum, Sylt, Föhr, Süderoogsand, Norderoogsand, Norderney, Borkem, Wangerooge, Spiekeroog, Langeoog, Baltrum, Helgoland / deät Lun lit.
* Germany Ownership ( Uninhabited ): Scharhörn, Neuwerk, Blaurt, Trischert.
* Dänemark Ownership ( Inhabited ): Pellworm, Hooge, Sylt, Fanø.
* Dänemark Ownership ( Uninhabited ): Norderoog, Most are sunken today.
* Sunken Islands: Düne / Dynen / Halem, Koresand, Griend ( Old Catholic Monk Holdout ) / Monnikenlangenoog, and an island possibly once called Tilbede in the Danish tongue.

There are also numerous other Frisian Islands that disappeared entirely from the centuries 1100 to 1800. Some of the Frisian Islands are not even lived on ! Some of the Frisian Islands were bought and resold between the countries of Dänemark, Germany and Niederlande. The Dynastic Families of these countries traded ownership of these islands between themselves over the centuries.

* How did the Medieval Frisians communicate ?
In the 20th, 19th and 18th centuries they were recorded as having communicated by oral and handwritten messages carried from island to island by boats.

* What religion did the Frisians practice ?
Historically Germanic-Paganism and other kinds of Germanic-Paganism within those areas. Later, Catholicism of the Latin Rite and of various Catholic Traditions. Lutheranism as well as other Protestant Christian types especially after the 16th century. Forms of Germanic-Paganism were still practiced by large communities of Frisians before, during and after the Catholic Church in Frisia. Some of my Frisian ancestors are recorded as having practiced Catholicism as well as Paganism.

* What kind of work did the Frisians do ?
In the 20th, 19th and 18th centuries in the Frisian Islands, Dänemark, Germany and Niederlande many Frisians were farmers and fisherman. Cartography, Adventuring, Seafaring.

* What kind of cultural music did the Frisians play ?
This is * SOME * of the kind of music that "Pagan"-Frisians, "Pagan"-Danish, "Pagan"-Germans, "Pagan"-Norwegians or should I say "Pagan "Skald"" / "Pagan-Scandinavians" played historically throughout those areas as well as in Frisia, the Frisian Islands. This can be considered mostly authentic revived "Pagan" music because they draw from the Poetic Edda as well as authentic Scandinavian-Pagan cultural sources.

* This can be considered a present day Frisian band of musicians who call themselves Baldrs Draumar. They sing of Frisia and sometimes sing in the Frisian language. While this music is not music that was played by Frisians historically this could be considered modern cultural Frisian music:

* Fanø Island: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih9bLofT8BY

Some of my Frisian ancestors are recorded as having lived down the road from a resort house owned and frequented by the King of Dänemark in the mid 19th century.

* Do I share the Frisian culture ?
I do. I share this culture as in what was given to me. Some of this authentic information comes from the early 20th, 19th, 18th, 17th, 16th centuries in the Frisian Islands.

* Where can my Frisian ancestors be traced to ?
So far I can trace my Frisian ancestors to the Frisian Islands of Amrum, Föhr and Sylt with excellent documentation as well as to some Frisian Islands that no longer exist after the century 1700 due to the flooding and disappearing of those islands. I can also trace my Frisian ancestors to other surrounding areas as well. To the countries of Dänemark, Flevoland, Germany, Niederlande, Norway.

* How far back can I trace my Frisian ancestry ?
~ 1450.

* What names are in my Frisian ancestry ?
Braren / Brären, Rolufs / Rölufs, Ölofs, Söenck, Söencken, Sönck, Wöggens, Böhne, Thür, Ìng, Peters, Jurgens, Ercken, Christensen, Arfest, others.

* What Frisian languages did my Frisian ancestors speak ?
They spoke the Frisian language. Frisian such as Öomrang, Söl'ringen as well as Dutch, Dansk, Flemish, German, Swedish, Norwegian.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amrum_North_Frisian

* This is a short educational video on YouTube that I found on the History of Frisia / Fryslân / Friesland. Though from what I hear it's not very accurate because these areas are not only part of Dänemark / Niederlande they are also part of Germany and at one time these areas were unified to their own people called the Frisians:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWQov56eO2g

* What authentic Churches can be found on the Frisian Islands and in the surrounding areas ?
Authentic Catholic Churches, Lutheran Churches ( Some that were made Lutheran from Catholic Churches later on ). Churches like Saint Laurentii especially hold relevant genealogical records and grave stones. There were many Catholic Churches in all of those areas before the Protestant Reformations. Some of those Churches were left to destruction and others were converted into Lutheran Churches or other Protestant Christian Churches. The Lutherans even went back and tried to rewrite some of the Frisian-Catholic History when they went to war with Catholicism !

Some of them were more recently built in the 18th century or are now claimed to have been built in the 18th, 17th centuries but actually were built long before that.

* The Realities of History and Genealogical Research:
Remember: When it comes to genealogical research just because someone comes from a place traceable on paper that doesn't necessarily mean that person or those people actually belong to the authentic people that live / lived there in those areas.

Most people in the U.S. are very confused when it comes to historicity. They only have access to bad information. Most people claiming to be x descendant or whatever aren't what they think they are. Most of the "Frisians" that came in waves to the U.S. were not real Frisians, apparently. Frisians have their own special language and culture that developed separately from the different groups of people there. Frisians are legitimately a minority group in many places in the world as well as in Frisia. There are the Frisian Islands, NordFriesland, Friesland / Fryslân and those places are all completely different areas.

Sadly, a historian that researches different groups of people will eventually find that entire nations of people were wiped out by their opposition and their authentic histories were erased, garbled and rewritten by that opposition. Artifacts were seized, spoils of war were traded.. things happened. Proving this is very difficult, costly, takes many years and requires an entire team of historians, researchers, and other experts to get the true and accurate history for situations like that !

An example of the previous would be the English and French wars during the time of Saint Joan de Arc ! Or an even better example of this would be the Pygmy People. The Pygmy Peoples although usually very poor have among the most interesting of cultures of those areas. Their histories and cultures should be well documented and preserved !

The Pygmy people are some of the rarest people on Earth ! One of the best examples of the previous would be the complicated situations between Native Americans and European American settlers.

* Please see this YouTube video on Pygmy Peoples:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kuf1TgaCgk

* My other Genealogical and Historical Research:
I don't feel bad when I state the facts, especially when it comes to the American Revolutionary War. And the facts and realities of that war is that it was mostly Catholics that fought in and won that war. The French Monarchy won that war for the American Colonials who sought to establish their new government. They provided * EVERYTHING * to them. They gave them * EVERYTHING * including weapons, uniforms, military officers, soldiers, etc.. They provided experts in intelligence and war. The mainstream American books about that war and that era do not do those men justice. If an accurate history is to be preserved then it needs to be preserved correctly !

* So who writes the history books in the United States ? Where does all of this bad and fake information come from ?
Groups of people that fabricate / alter authentic history to give to the next generation of Americans. Always investigate the author and the sources !

* Why do I care about this ?
Because not only is all of this fascinating this is also part of my own verified family history.

* What have I found out before ?
In this U.S. entire definitions of words were changed from their intended meaning, entire histories were censored and rewritten to hide or conceal the factual histories of groups, historical events, etc..

American high schools, so called American "Ivy League" Colleges and Universities are considered complete garbage by European academics because of the ways that they teach the offered curriculum and because of the censored and inaccurate materials they use to teach whatever it is that they are teaching ! They also often times don't entirely know the scope of what they are teaching nor should they be teaching at all to begin with !

* Why was this done here ?
Nationalism Movements. Censorship. Other reasons.

* Is Nationalism wrong ?
No, some kinds of nationalism isn't necessarily wrong. The kind of Nationalism that has been seen in other countries could be considered wrong because of how censorship of books and materials happened there historically. Censorship leads to oppression.

* What is book censorship ? What is censorship ? Why is book censorship bad ?
This is a Wikipedia article on book censorship:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_censorship_in_the_United_States

Book censorship is bad because it is important to be able to know the real and authentic history of different groups and places in the world.

Censorship is bad because when something is censored about a group of people then decent folk can't act to help them.

* What social-ethnic-religious groups do I belong to ?
My former faith is Catholic and I belong to whatever is in my authentic ancestry. Although I really enjoy * MY * Frisian-Scandinavian culture. I also enjoy my French ancestral culture. The French have such a rich culture, but technically the French cannot be deemed an "ethnic group" because the French allowed for just about anyone to become French ! It's strange I know. Anyone from any ethnicity can be French and the French have their own unique Catholic culture !

* My ancestral research mission
I am attempting to get photographs or painted portraits of each of my direct ancestors maternal and paternal for 10 generations before me, as well as get photographs of the headstones and all available record proofs about each person in my ancestry back 10 generations before me.

* The monetary cost of records and the monetary cost of ancestral research:
To get started usually just one record would cost approximately $20 - $25 United States Dollars if the records of the person being researched are located in the United States. If the records of the ancestor were located in Europe it's about the same, anywhere from €20 - €25 Euros. For Instance: a certified birth record for a person that was born after 1910 in the United States would cost around ~$25 United States Dollars today, and this record can be acquired from the institution in the town or in the region in the U.S. that deals with birth certificates.

County birth certificates weren't issued by standard until after the year 1900 in the United States, before that the authentic Bible Records / Church Baptismal Records were usually the primary source for birth information. Acquiring a certified birth certificate for ones self and for each parent and then for each of their parents, and then for each of their parents back to around ~1900 would cost 1 (yourself) + 2 (2 parents) + 4 (4 grand parents) + 8 (8 great grand parents) = 15 * $25 = $375.

As you can see, the cost of acquiring physical records can quickly add up. Most Internet resources as of today cannot be trusted for Genealogical History research at all, and most Internet resources are limited due to disinformation. However, there are trustworthy resources available on the Internet such as access to authentic digitized Newspapers, Census Records, etc., and even after getting those records they should be verified as authentic by comparing the information to the authentic source and then by using research and analysis skills to verify the record.

A budget of $x before many records were digitized into certain databases would allow for a researcher to go as far back as the year ~1700 as long as the bloodline were well documented, if it weren't documented then it would be up to the researcher to gather the documentation. It could sometimes take years for a researcher to gather all available documentation on one person in his or her ancestry, depending on how long it would take to gather all of the available records about the person.

Authentic paper records for births at hospitals that are stored by the U.S. Government / local authority are usually but not always accurate information, these documents allow for tracing a bloodline back to a certain decade. The best way to get started is by getting the Certified Birth Certificates for each person as far back as 1910.

* Who taught me Genealogy Research skills ?
My Grandmother, individuals from the Catholic Church, individuals from the "Mormon Church" who actually don't enjoy being called "Mormon", people deemed expert genealogists by their peers, expert researchers, individuals belonging to the DAR and the SAR organizations, many other individuals who are so called experts in genealogy and this kind of research.

* Some of my interests in Genealogical Research:
I am interested in listing my family's eligibility for memberships in genealogical "by-blood-only" Orders and Organizations to make it extremely easy for future generations coming from myself and from my siblings to become members of such Orders and Organizations with extreme ease, if they ever wanted to.

To demonstrate my genealogical skills I opted to join an organization that would legally prove my descent from men who fought in the American Revolutionary War, I was then conferred membership in the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution in 2016 because I was able to legally prove my direct descent from men who fought in the American Revolutionary War, and both my name and picture were published in its Autumn of 2016 magazine issue. It was a great investigation into 3 of my American Patriot ancestors. I wrote a few historical research papers about those people and one of them was published in a historical journal under a pseudonym.

My favorite American Revolutionary War / French Revolutionary War Patriot ancestors are the Frenchmen Michel Garoutte, Antoine Joseph Marie d'Espinassy. This kind of research is so fascinating.

* What are my favorite time periods ?
My favorite time period would be Medieval France, Medieval Frisia, Medieval Germany. England, Niederlande, Frisian Islands.

Officially I am a living representative of those historically important dead men because they are my legally proven direct ancestors. They cannot speak for themselves because they are dead, so I speak for them based on their authentic records. I continue to research the American Revolutionary War and American Colonial History because it is fascinating. These people played important roles in the formation of the U.S..

* What are some of the different modes of descent ?
Realistically a person descends either directly or direct lineally and not any other way. Direct descent in the sense of primogeniture would be from father to eldest son and direct descent in the sense of direct would be from father to any son. There is also matrilineal descent which is descent from the female bloodline. Direct lineal descent is descending from any of those people in any combination but it is still direct. Direct lineal descent is descending from great grandparents, etc. but as the eldest or maybe from a female of the grandparents. So long as you have the direct or direct lineal blood in you then it's direct.

* What is "Legal" Descent ?
There is also the term "Legal" descent which should not be confused with the American term and definitions. The definition I'm not talking about is: "Legal Descent is the title, whereby a person, upon the death of his ancestor, acquires the estate of the latter, as his heir at law."

"Legal Descent" could be inaccurately attributed to people especially if the different DNA results of the person claiming descent from the bloodline doesn't match the authentic genealogical proofs-of-parentage belonging to the supposed bloodline, then it's obvious that person doesn't entirely belong to the bloodline. What does that mean ? It could mean that person was adopted by the family and doesn't actually have the blood or it could mean the person is illegitimate and actually belongs to an entirely different bloodline.

One of the ways to know for sure if a person belongs to the bloodline being investigated on paper is to match up DNA marker results from various Ancestral DNA tests taken from that person and then to compare the results from the various Ancestral DNA tests to the authentic and verified bloodline information on paper, especially when dealing with extensive genealogy information that can be legitimately traced back to whatever point and area. If the information matches then it's probably true that person is descended from the people traceable on the authentic and verified paper records. There is also the problem of records belonging to people in the bloodline, authenticating those records and then understanding them in context.

Another way it is done is by taking different DNA marker tests and comparing the results to "other people" who are "verified" to have come from the bloodline in some way of descent, but realistically that's bogus when dealing with certain things. The best and most cost effective way to do it today is by gathering all authentic and verified proofs-of-parentage, then by taking a few specialized ancestral DNA tests, and finally by comparing all of the information and sources to verify everything matches. If the information doesn't match then it's likely the person doesn't entirely belong to the bloodline traceable on paper.

There are actually many different kinds of ancestral DNA tests and each one has a different monetary cost.

Personally I have taken a few different kinds of ancestral DNA tests and the results of those tests have all revealed a high concentration of the areas of Scandinavia, Norway, Western Germany / Germanic, Frisia / Frisian and those areas. So without going into even more detail and research I can probably conclude that I wholly come from the people shown on my certified, verified and authenticated proofs-of-parentage handed down to me from my Grandmother. The interesting thing about DNA tests like this though is that they are flawed by themselves because of the ways in which they test.

* This is a list of Genealogical DNA tests shown in this Wikipedia article:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogical_DNA_test

* What is the difference between ancestral DNA tests and other DNA tests ?
The difference is that ancestral DNA tests test for DNA markers for ancestry whereas any other DNA tests do not. Ancestral DNA tests are specifically designed for ancestral testing.

* Authenticating records
Records could be inaccurate, especially if they were ever modified, but generally Church records such as Birth, Baptismal, Confirmation, Holy Communion, Marriage, Death records are usually but not always accurate information about the person and give away a lot of details and truth about the person.

People of every century before the year 2,000 took religion and Church * VERY * seriously. The Church was always the go to place for * EVERY * community in Europe as well as in the Americas.

The clergy of the church were charged with maintaining accurate records about people after they became official members of the church, even if they did things to hide or conceal that information for whatever reason. The authentic records about that person would still become available in the future, but this isn't always the case.

Records are not always trust worthy until after the records can be authenticated, analyzed and held up to scrutiny. Sometimes a researcher might find that some records ( not genealogical records ) about a person are fraudulent or slowly built up against a person because the person is a politician or a target of a group of people. That ties in more with politics and I won't touch that here.

Obviously not every person in a bloodline may have been married when a child was made and not every child was claimed or maybe there is no documentation on a child's entrance into this world.. so proving descent by other methods is still possible. And of course every genealogist should do that after obtaining records belonging to their direct ancestors. Each record should be thoroughly analyzed.

The records provide the paper trail and the details needed to find out who is the next set of people in the bloodline. When retrieving records always note the source of where the records are located, where they were acquired and provide a time stamp of when they were acquired and who acquired them.

* More about me:
Aside from all of that other research I really enjoy Mathematics, Mathemagic, Writing, History, Video Games, Computer / Software Programming, Information Security, Historical Research, Catholic History, Languages, Cultures, Art, Sciences. I am fascinated by languages, I once learned a little bit of Gaelic as a project because it sounded interesting.

I am also on a mission to relinquish U.S. Citizenship and immigrate to a different country. This is more information about that:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNJYecWoBcs
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relinquishment_of_United_States_nationality

* Why do I want to relinquish U.S. Citizenship ?
I am not wealthy, but I could be. I have been oppressed for ~16 years of my life and I do not enjoy this place. There is a very large world out there with plenty of decent people everywhere. I would rather live in Frisia, Niederlande, Norway, Germany or France. Creativity is not fostered here, it never was. Creativity is silenced and oppressed and while California is probably the freest State in the U.S. the U.S. is just not for me anymore. There are some really bad areas of California that shouldn't even be considered California !

* What is a Netizen ?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netizen

* My current works:
I am a Computer Programmer and I once owned and ran a small company that developed web applications. I also did numerous other things in the computer IT field. Now I am focusing on projects I started many years ago and postponed development for several years.

I have also just finished writing my second book on Mnemonics, Lightning Mental Calculating, Loci / Memory and Algorithms and I am in the process of publishing this book. The book details 160 different Lightning Mental Calculating Algorithms and Tables that allow for mentally calculating, it also shows some of their histories and possible origins. Many of these systems are unknown to the world, and very few people in the world are capable of such feats.

Myself and other "Lightning Human Calculators" or "Counters" have gone on to publicly demonstrate these things. The book will be available only to certain groups. Why do I know about these things ? Because for a few years in my early 20's I would sit in my house all day on some days and I would think only of algorithms. When I had finally gotten away from my life stresses in my early 20's I spent a summer developing my abilities. I'm looking to get the world record on mental multiplication.

I wrote a book about it in my early 20's and I bought an ISBN number for it but it was not published or circulated. Now I wrote another book about these and this time I'm going to create an original demonstration video for each one of these algorithms showing myself explaining each of the 160 different calculating algorithms and tables I discovered, some of which I developed myself. These are my original work. All of these systems have been tailored to my own systems of what I call The Wheel which is a 10-20 location / loci system on paper in a beautiful spiral of numbers similar to the shape of the Fibonacci pattern.

Once memorized correctly systems like these allow for various things like finding the day of the week instantly in the mind for any number date given. I call this Lightning Calendar Calculating and based on my extensive research only ~200 people in the world including myself are known to be capable of this naturally. After I am done making each demonstration video and after the book is officially published, I plan to enter the Memoriad and hopefully the Mental Calculating World Cup.

There is an extensive bibliographia / bibliography and some other really cool things in my work. Each table and algorithm in the digitized book will have a YouTube link that links to a YouTube video that I will make showing a demonstration of myself explaining these algorithms and tables. I plan to put on a public demonstration of my abilities after I draw a crowd in the near future.

* These are some Wikipedia articles about Human / Mental Calculators like myself:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_calculator
https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoriad
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Calculation_World_Cup

* How can I prove this to anyone ?
I welcome anyone to approach me with a calculator and I will show you I am often faster than the calculator !

Oh and trust me, the only reason anyone knows about this is because I showed demonstration videos about this.

This is an example of one of my videos, although they will all be professionalized and recorded at various locations with nice backgrounds, such as at the beach or in the mountains with nice background scenery and I will show how these algorithms relate to nature and shapes as well.

* My Lightning Calendar Calculating Demonstration:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlJEdIzxNA0 ( deleted )
https://www.Vimeo.com/gcjohnsonchevalier

* Why am I publicizing this information here ?
To show that this is my original work so it can never be stolen from me.

* Who could use these mathematical systems ?
Anyone who can at least mentally multiply two digit numbers against other two digit numbers.

That would be any combination of two digit numbers which is 10 to 99 against and other combinations of two digit numbers from 10 to 99. Mentally multiplying three digit numbers against other three digit numbers is not difficult once the mind is trained to do so. An example of this would be mentally multiplying numbers like: 365 * 489.

* Who could benefit from these systems / tables / algorithms ?
Everyone.

* Where can these systems / tables / algorithms be applied ?
Everywhere.

Personally, I have never really cared for the public education system and I probably never will.

* My Diagnoses:
More recently I was officially diagnosed with a form of Synesthesia. I am also capable of producing at will a special kind of Frisson all over my body. No, Frisson is not goosebumps.

My eye color changes from the colors of gray to green to blue.

I am a man, I stand ~177 Centimetres / 510

* Why do I need to mention this here ?
So I can always prove who I am to anyone at any point in time anywhere I am in the world.

* Where was I educated ?
Public and Private institutions, the Roman Catholic Church, Individually.

* What was I taught and who mostly taught me ?
For several years off and on throughout my youth I was taught privately by 2 nuns of a Religious Order of the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church as well as their brother, they were good friends of my Grandmother. I went back to them in my early 20's and again in my mid 20's. I am also an autodidact.

I went back to the Nuns off and on to be taught at different times throughout my teenage years and they even wanted me to become a priest when I was 15 years old, but I declined. I was taught Catechetics, Catholic Church History, History; Some Mathematics, Sciences, Apologetics, Martyrology and various other subjects. I was mostly catechized by those nuns.

* Why was I Catholic ?
I was Catholic because my Grandmother was Catholic. Because like her it made more sense to me than anything else. I also spent a little bit of time with the Eastern Orthodox Church before. The Eastern Orthodox Church uses Iconography and they have a beautiful history seated in Byzantium, Greece and numerous other places.

* Why is the Catholic Church so amazing ?
Because it touches every corner of the earth, every community and everything in history for the last ~2,000 years. The historical aspect is certainly fascinating and especially the records they hold are even more useful for historical research. My Catholic faith journey after a certain point has been very rocky, but now it is over.

Unfortunately due to my difficulty in acquiring or being conferred certain sacraments I decided to no longer practice the Catholic Faith and I do not claim to be Catholic anymore.

I always went back and forth from Paganism to Catholicism, but Paganism is better.

* Why am I placing this information on my FindAGrave Profile page ?
Because these projects also tie in with my genealogy research projects and this is the correct place to put this information. Practitioners of any religion need to make known their faith so rights in that are established.

* My Genealogical Interests:
I am proud to know and to be able to prove that I am a Frisian-American, that is, I am an American of mostly Frisian ancestral descent, or to put it even more simply: I am a human being that is descended mostly in concentration from people who lived in the Frisian Islands and all around those areas as well as in Dänemark, Norway, Sweden and Scandinavia. By concentration is different from other ways of descent.

Those Frisian people I come from spoke the Frisian languages. Because of this I can call myself, be recognized as and style myself as a "Frisian-American" and I have done this.

Much of the information about Frisians and Frisian culture that is available on the Internet in the USA to English speakers and readers is false.

In the future I am going to be making a professional educational videos about Frisians showing a long discussion / discourse between myself and my cousins whom I have contacted in mainland Germany and Norway. They have agreed to come onto live video chat with me to discuss our proven blood relation and to discuss the Norwegian and the Frisian people of those specific centuries.

* How do I know I am related to those people ?
Because in my genealogical research I uncovered them and established contact with them, they went over my genealogical paperwork and they saw that we are indeed related. How are such things proven ? A genealogist matches up records to see who is related to who by blood.

* What will we discuss ?
We will discuss the Frisian people and we will be on a live video chat where we will go over paperwork as well as go over the various Internet resources and show how those resources on the Internet that deal with information about Frisians of the 20th, 19th and 18th centuries are incorrect.

* This is a good example of one of the Islands named Fanø:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan%C3%B8 although this article written in English is inaccurate.

* Understanding Frisians:
Understanding what Frisians are is really difficult because not all of them are generally unified like a group of people with a shared culture and a shared language anymore like how you would see when looking at Norwegians or Swedes of present day. The Frisians in Friesland, NordFriesland and other areas are a different people than the Frisians that lived on the Frisian Islands. The history is very strange. The Frisian Islands were broken up in ownership and divided to Dänemark, Germany, Niederlande and other countries, and the Frisian Islands were flooded and turned into resorts to make money.

If anyone were to look at videos or pictures of some of the Frisian Islands from overhead then you would see exactly where the lands were flooded. You can even see houses / objects under the water in some places ! The Islands continue to flood into today and in the next few hundred years it's possible that some of the islands will disappear entirely !

There are these unique Frisian languages that survived and were spoken by the people who lived there and still are today. I mean, obviously people move around everywhere and when they move they take their language and their culture with them or raise up their children with that. My own Grandmother talked about it and showed me some of that culture, especially the dresses the women wore.

Many Frisians were / are different genetically than everyone else.

So yet again we find more Internet sources that has bad information about Frisians. This one claims Frisian is spoken by a little over half a million people.. this couldn't be further from the truth. Frisian is spoken by far less people than that. Most likely, most Frisian language variations are spoken by less than ~100,000 people worldwide and the rarer ones are spoken by less than ~7,000. Most Frisian groups are legitimately a minority, apparently. And, just because someone might know some of the words of that language that doesn't mean that person can be counted as knowing and speaking the language. There are no real accurate numbers on the number of speakers, but the claims of half a million people speaking it is outrageously inaccurate. Also, just because someone might be able to speak it doesn't mean they are authentically Frisian since to be Frisian is to have the blood and the culture as well.

* Is there a Frisian-Catholic culture ?
There absolutely was a Frisian Catholic Culture / Tradition historically and there still is today among those of Frisian descent who practice Catholicism, but throughout the history of the Frisians they mostly resisted the Catholic Church.

There is Blessed Titus Brandsma and Saint Willibrord

https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Brandsma
https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Willibrord

* Exactly what am * I * talking about anyway ?
Many materials were badly translated from different languages and this brought an incorrect portrayal and context of the reality of things, there were people giving information who were not really from the areas they claimed to have been from. The "Mennonite Frisians" were a completely different kind of people from the Frisians that lived in Friesland and the Frisian Islands, and not all of the people who lived in those areas were authentically Frisian, they just lived there.

Also, there were high populations of Mennonite "Frisians" who weren't even ethnically Frisian ! They were an entirely different kind of "German" or they weren't even German at all ! Many weren't even considered German because they weren't ! There were large waves of "Frisian" Mennonites who came to America early on and those people were not even considered Frisian by authentic Frisian groups !

Historically Frisians were a group of people who spoke a unique language and who developed their own culture. They used a special set of Runes and they were heavily mixed in later on with the Dutch, Danish, Norwegians, Swedish, Germanic because the Frisian Islands stretch far all up and down the coastal areas of those mainlands ! The authentic Frisian groups found in the Frisian Islands each spoke a different "dialect" or variation of the Frisian language all the way up to the 20th Century and even into today ! Each Island had its own variation of that unique culture.

* Why is information about Frisians in the United States incorrect ?
Because much of the "Frisian" populations that came to the Americas in waves early on were Mennonites and the books they wrote and published here contain some inaccurate information about Frisians. To be * VERY * clear: Frisians apparently were separated by the different kinds of Frisian Languages, their personal faith and a variety of other factors. They were separated in a way because of the different groups of Frisians that lived on the Frisian Islands, NordFriesland, Friesland. These are all completely different areas. Mennonites did not live on the Frisian Islands. Also, just because someone lived there doesn't mean they were authentically Frisian. Frisians are Western-Germanic as well as Scandinavian, Dutch, Danish and whatever else. None of my Frisian ancestors were Mennonites, they were Catholics, Lutherans and Pagans. They had Frisian-Scandinavian or Frisian-German names and they spoke the Frisian languages. That's what is in my Frisian bloodline. It's really interesting. So far I can trace my "Frisian" bloodline back to ~1450 with decent documentation. Understanding what Frisians really are is difficult because of the incorrect information about them on the Internet.

The cultural ties between those different groups are somewhat similar. There were many waves of people from Germany that went to live on the Frisian Islands after they were bought and traded by Dänemark, Germany and Niederlande. The Frisian Islands were turned into resort towns and monetized. Clearly people move around everywhere and they mix blood with different people, but usually the culture and the language is carried on and blended by the descendants. This situation is somewhat similar, but not exactly the same as the situation / history of the Hawaiian Islands where many authentic Native Hawaiian people were wiped out and their islands were turned into resorts for tourism.

* What is Catholic Culture and Catholic Tradition ?
What is the difference between Polish-Catholics, French-Catholics, Romanian-Catholics, Spanish-Catholics, Mexican-Catholics, English-Catholics, Italian-Catholics, etc. ? I mean yes, there are all of those different Rites / Liturgical Rites in the Catholic Church, such as the Latin / Roman Rite and others and technically the phrase: "Roman Catholic" is a misnomer. So really, wouldn't it be accurate to say that each country and each Catholic community in each different area has its own special kind of culture inside of that community ? I mean.. since it developed that area culturally throughout the centuries it was present there ? Personally, I have seen many different kinds of culture in different Catholic communities ! How are these things formed ? I can't explain that here !

* What information on the Internet about Frisians is not accurate ?
Much of the information that is available on the Internet in the U.S. that describes Frisians, Friesland, the Frisian Islands, NordFriesland, Fryslân, Frisian culture and the Frisian languages is not accurate information. For many years the Internet in different regions across the U.S. has been isolated to cached servers and only certain results / resources turn up based on the region where that information is queried, regardless.

In the future I will make lengthy educational videos showing all of the bad and inaccurate information on the Internet about Frisian people and Frisian culture. I will go on and demonstrate how Wikipedia and other sources that are available on the Internet gives bad information about the Frisian people / Frisian culture / Frisian Languages of today and especially of the 20th, 19th and 18th centuries.

* How do I know this is true ?
Because I have all kinds of certified and verified records and documentation on family members in my direct Frisian ancestry that was handed down to me and those records prove that numerous Internet resources about Frisian people is not accurate or not true. In fact, I remember back in around 2016 when I was looking at information about Frisians on the Internet I had gotten into an argument with some idiot on Wikipedia who tried to claim that the King of Dänemark never lived on the Frisian Islands when I had mentioned to Wikipedia that documentation that was handed down to me about my own direct Frisian ancestors clearly showed that the King of Dänemark had lived in a resort house down the road from them and the children of the King of Dänemark played with the children of my own direct Frisian great great grandparents, and later they were given trinkets by that King's kids !

* What else have I found in my ancestry and what is ethnicity ?
I am also ethnically German, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Scandinavian as well as French ( From Provence, Southern France ) and finally we found some Scottish and English in there as well, but since I am mostly Frisian I can legally claim the "Frisian-American" title and I have done so. My French ancestry is scarce.

* What is the real difference between belonging to an ethnic group versus being a citizen or national of the country ?
There is a big difference. Being a citizen of a country doesn't always mean that the citizen belongs to that ethnicity. An ethnicity means that you * ALSO * have the blood of the people that have long since lived in that country. An ethnicity means you descend * FROM * the people that have long since lived in that country from generation to generation and you have their blood and genetics in you.

There is no such thing as an "American ethnicity" or an "American culture". Real American culture is culture created by different groups of people who live in America and who share their own cultural ties. Mainstream American culture is a twisted version or twisted monetized version of the different authentic cultures of groups of people from various places in the world.

An example of how authentic culture is twisted in the United States would be Halloween, Christmas and Easter. Halloween to be exact, is a Catholic Holiday and most likely has Catholicized elements of Germanic-Paganism within it and is actually a set of 3 consecutive days together. All Hallows Eve / All Saints Eve, All Saints Day and All Souls Day.

Mexican-Catholics have their own cultural version of those holidays that they call the "Days of the Dead". But, just because it is twisted from its original meaning and form doesn't mean it isn't cool or beautiful, because it is beautiful, but it isn't in the original style.

I enjoyed Catholicism in its purest form when I practiced it. Christmas is a Catholic Holiday and it means Christ's Mass, the Catholic Mass for the celebration of the Birth of Jesus Christ in the Pope Gregorian XIII Calendar. This is the standard calendar that is used in the Western World today. Easter is the full part of the Liturgical Calendar that celebrates different key times in the life of Jesus Christ, and it is approximately 50 days long. As you can see, the original holidays have absolutely nothing to do with pine trees or bunnies.

* What is Ethnicity and Culture ?
Are all of the people living in Germany today ethnically / biologically German ? What does it mean to be German ? Ethnicity isn't just culture, it is also blood. Are all of the people living in England today English ? What is culturally English ? What does it mean to be English ? What does it mean to be Norwegian ? What does it mean to be Scandinavian ? What does it mean to be African ? What does it mean to be Japanese ?

Japanese are clearly very different from Koreans both culturally and genetically and yet Korea and the Korean Islands are only about ~700 miles away from Japan. Their islands were isolated from other groups of people and for centuries they developed their own culture and beliefs and genetic patterns. This is very similar to the ancient Frisian people who lived on the Frisian Islands and surrounding areas, 'ya know.. the same islands that were flooded in the 20th, 19th and 18th centuries. Many of them still live there today, though, but not all of the people who live there now today are authentically Frisian.

* You can actually see part of the land under the water in this photograph of one of the Frisian Islands, look at each overhead photo of each island to prove it:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisian_Islands#/media/File:Luftaufnahmen_Nordseekueste_2012-05-by-RaBoe-119.jpg

* What am I made of exactly ?
Biologically I would say I'm mostly Frisian-Scandinavian-Danish. I also have some Native-American Ancestry. I mostly come from people who lived in the Frisian Islands where the people spoke the Frisian languages. I have 0% Afro-DNA, 0% Hispanic, 0% Slavic/Russian according to testing. Johnson's were English-Scandinavian.

The ones that lived in those areas long ago ( who are now long dead ) and the ones who live there today are different genetically and culturally from the people who lived in and live today in Dänemark, Germany and Niederlande.

Some Frisian groups have their own ethnic group and they were distinctly different culturally and sometimes genetically from the people living in Dänemark, Germany and Niederlande today. The people in those areas share genetic traits though.

* More about Germanic-Paganism
The word Pagan was used by Catholics to refer to anyone who was a Heathen / Germanic-Pagan or who practiced any kind of observable polytheism. This most likely meant anyone who was not a Catholic and who was not a Christian of another denomination. One who practiced any kind of faith that was not Catholicized or Christianized was called a Pagan by the Catholic Church. The authentic 'religious systems' of what are now called Paganism were always preserved down through the ages by those groups that preserved it. Authentic 'Paganism' is Germanic. Many elements of authentic Germanic / Scandinavian-Paganism was Catholicized and handed down to today. Some of these elements can be seen today in Catholicism and Protestantism. The Catholic Church Catholicized elements of Germanic-Paganism to bring Pagans into communion with the Church.

Sorry for being so redundant, but it's necessary for me to be redundant in order for me to deliver the correct message.
